# FastAPI Start Template
_Use this template to do the initial setup of your FastAPI project._

### Setting Up
> All the commands are run inside the project directory.

`i.` **Create your new repo** using this template. [How to create a repository from a template?](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

`ii.` **Clone** the repo to your computer.

`iii.` To **install project dependencies**, run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` from the project directory. `requirements.txt` constains the full list of libraries to be installed.

`iv.` Now you can perform a **dry-run** to make sure that the template works. Run `python ./src/main.py`.

`v.` You can set some settings like server `host` and `port` by specifying them in `.env` file. Refer to `/src/config.py` file to see the list of available parameters.

`vi.` Create your own modules to turn the template into your project.
